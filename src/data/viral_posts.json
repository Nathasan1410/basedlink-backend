        "body": "These 5 tiny habits massively improved my well-being: 1. Walking 20,000 steps per day I'm convinced walking is the *single* best thing you can do for your health & creativity. I used to walk 4,000 steps per day—and I was miserable. Why? Because I thought everything had to be done at my desk. • Meetings? Needed to be on Zoom. • Writing? Needed to be at my keyboard. Turns out, this is 100% wrong. Anything I can do on a walk, I do on a walk: • Emailing • Outlining • Meetings I sit at my desk only for the few things that require a computer. 2. Get sunlight first thing in the morning Gazing at the sun as it rises will regulate your circadian rhythm. This leads to stable energy & better sleep. 3. Slugging a morning electrolyte supplement I used to wake up and cram a double espresso. The result? • Jitters • Midday crash • A crippling caffeine addiction That changed when I heard Andrew Huberman describe the science behind it: Your body isn't ready for caffeine in the first 90 minutes. But it is ready for electrolytes. So now I start every morning with them. This accomplishes 2 important things: 1. Boosts your energy immediately 2. Makes it so you feel the caffeine later in the day Now, onto the next habit: 4. Cooking all my own meals This is the most immediate upgrade you can make to your energy levels. I used to order out everything—because it \"saved time.\" But it actually ended up costing me time in the long run. So I eat the same basic foods every day: • Eggs • Skyr • Rice • Beef • Salmon • Every fruit & vegetable The result? Stable, predictable, smooth energy. 5. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day—even on weekends. I used to be a spartan during the week, sleeping from 9 PM to 5 AM every day. On weekends, I would go to bed much later and sleep in. Then on Sunday, I'd struggle to fall asleep, wake up groggy Monday, and the cycle would continue. So now it's 9 to 5 daily. This schedule has my energy at all-time highs.",

Or is it the AI Ghostwriter who uses AI to: • Brainstorm 10 newsletter ideas • Write a sample draft • And sends it over 3 hours later? Exactly. You get the idea.

It's one of the best books I've ever read on building wealth. And these 13 quotes will change your entire perception of money: 1. \"Making money isn't evil, greedy, shallow, or vain. Your biggest obstacle to getting rich is the harmful meaning you've attached to it.\" 2. \"Making money is nothing more than a neutral exchange of value. Making money is proof you're adding value to people's lives. Aiming to get rich is aiming to be useful to the world.\" 3. \"To get rich, don't think about what's valuable to you. Think about what's valuable to others.\" 4. \"Making money is a skill. Learn it and practice it like you would any other.\" 5. \"Money is a great motivator. It works better than force, rules, punishment, or appealing to generosity. Great art has been created in pursuit of great profit.\" 6. \"The world is full of money. There's no shortage. So capture the value you create. Charge for what you do.\" 7. \"Charge more than is comfortable to your current self-image. Value yourself higher, than rise to fit this valuation.\" 8. \"The world needs more boldness. Refuse the comfortable addiction of a steady paycheck.\" 9. \"Instead of thinking of customers as leading to a sale, think of each sale as leading to a life-long relationship with a customer.\" 10. \"Ideas are worth almost nothing. Execution is everything. The world is filled with ideas, yet so few take action and make them happen.\" 11. \"Don't buy too many things, too big of a house, or hire too many people. Rich people who do this feel trapped and miserable. The less you buy, the more you're in control.\" 12. \"So no to more stuff. Say yes to more choices.\" 13. \"Money makes problems go away, but amplifies personality traits. Money won't change you – but it will amplify who you are.\"",

        "body": "In 1999, researchers David Dunning and Justin Kruger studied the bizarre case of McArthur Wheeler, a would-be bank robber who was caught after robbing two banks in broad daylight. Wheeler hadn't worn a mask, but instead had rubbed lemon juice on his face, believing it would make him invisible to cameras. He knew lemon juice was used as invisible ink, so inferred that it could be used to make himself invisible to security cameras. Even after he was caught, he was legitimately incredulous that his plan with the lemon juice hadn't worked. The researchers set out to determine whether people with low ability tend to overestimate their competence. They ran experiments that plotted actual performance in a range of pursuits against perceived performance. The key findings: • Bottom quartile performers dramatically overestimated their performance. • Top quartile performers slightly underestimated their performance. In simple terms, low performers are dramatically more overconfident than high performers. Dunning and Kruger wrote, \"The same incompetence that leads them to make wrong choices also deprives them of the savvy necessary to recognize competence, be it their own or anyone else's.\" This is a polite scientific phrasing for double whammy: The low competence also leads to an inability to recognize that low competence. Here's my rudimentary Dunning-Kruger Effect toolkit: 1. Identify your circle of competence and ruthlessly protect its boundaries. Know what you know (and what you don't!). 2. Get comfortable saying \"I don't know\" about anything. 3. Make a habit of regularly questioning your assumptions. Use this toolkit regularly. Recognize the signs. Fight back.",

Confidence Pays Off More Often Than Talent Confidence ensures you take 100% of the shots you see. • Unlocks exponential upside • Increases your surface area for luck • Enhances your resilience for when you are inevitably rejected 1 yes is more powerful than 100 nos. 2. Finding Your Niche is Hard AF Ikigai exercises are useful, but the process of finding your niche is hard. You have to accept that it's a mix of: • Relentless iteration • Constant self-reflection • Rapid content generation Keep going. 3. You Have Few True Friends True Friends are the ones that: • Show you respect when you need it most • Show you loyalty when the deck is stacked against you • Show their support when you have nothing to offer them Learn to identify them and protect those relationships. 4. Consistency > Hard Work How do you get great? By being good. Repeatedly. The best people understand life is a marathon, not a sprint. It's about showing up every day and delivering consistent results and upside. 5. Most People Suck at Setting Goals Setting lofty goals is often useless. It's good to have a vision, but oftentimes after setting a goal we realize it's not the right one. Instead, set anti-goals. Setting guardrails for what NOT to happen steers us on the right path. 6. Most Hacks are Created In Retrospect A heavy bag of luck is involved in success. Successful people always form hacks in retrospect to attribute their success. The only true hack is: an unrelenting work ethic and a constant expansion of your surface area of luck. 7. Happiness is Related to Who Not What Early on, material goods are our proxy for happiness. In the long-term, who we become is the solution for long-term happiness. • How you are working • What you are working on • Who you spend time with It's most important.",

        "body": "But most people don’t know how to tell a good story. 10 storytelling techniques to make you unstoppable in business and life: 1. Highlight The Problem Jobs highlighted user frustrations with existing tech. Identify your audience's pain points. Address them directly to build excitement for your solution. Make your audience nod along, thinking \"Yes, that's exactly my issue!\" 2. Build Anticipation Jobs teased \"3 revolutionary products\" before revealing they were all one device, the iPhone. Create suspense. Make your audience crave what comes next. Don't give everything away at once. Leave them wanting more. 3. Show Don’t Tell Jobs didn't just describe iPhone features. He demoed them live. Use visuals, demos, and storytelling to make concepts tangible. Let your audience experience your solution. Bring your ideas to life. 4. Use Strategic Repetition \"An iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator\" - Jobs repeated this to drive home the iPhone's 3-in-1 value. Repeat your key message creatively, not robotically. Make it stick. Make it memorable. 5. Connect To A Larger Vision Jobs tied the iPhone to Apple's history of revolutionary products, changing its name from \"Apple Computer\" to \"Apple.\" Your offer should serve a bigger vision and mission that you share with your customers. Show them the forest, not just the trees. 6. Make It Personal \"I didn't sleep a wink last night, I was so excited,\" Jobs shared. Vulnerability creates connection. Let your audience see the human behind the product. Your authenticity is your secret sales weapon. 7. Close With Inspiration Jobs ended with Wayne Gretzky's quote: \"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.\" Leave your audience inspired and motivated to take action. Give them a vision of the future they can't resist being part of. 8. Practice Relentlessly Jobs rehearsed for hours, perfecting every detail. Great storytelling looks effortless, but it's the result of deliberate practice. Treat your presentations like an athlete treats training. Repetition breeds excellence. 9. Simplify Complex Ideas Jobs made revolutionary tech accessible to everyone. Your audience shouldn't need a PhD to understand your value proposition. If you can’t explain your idea to a 5-year-old, simplify it until you can. 10. Create An Experience Jobs didn't just launch a product. He crafted an unforgettable moment. Turn your pitch into an immersive experience. Engage all senses. Make your audience feel like they're part of something special.",
